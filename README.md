# PA-911-Calls-EDA

In this Project I have analyzed data of 911 emergency calls of Montgomery County, PA a [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mchirico/montcoalert). I have performed initial data exploration, feature creation and exploratory data analysiss (EDA) by crating various charts and heatmaps.

I have performed analysis with the help of NumPy,Pandas,Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.
